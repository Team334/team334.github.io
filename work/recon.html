    <p>
        Recon is a scouting app for the 2017 FRC competition steamworks. It is built on the principles: <br>

        - centralized datastore with mongodb <br>
        - convienient data access with socketio <br>
        - powerful analytics with numpy <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Used by all team members throughout the competition, the database and app properly handled multiple submittion requests. Data was easily available to team members.
        With beautiful graphs and charts, team strategists and leaders could analyze data faster than before.
