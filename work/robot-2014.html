        The 2014 robot, One Bad BrooklynKnight (O.B.B) competed in the FRC 2014 Aerial Asist competition. Aerial Assist is loosely based off of soccer, with a ball, two goals, and goalies. For the autonomous period, the robot shot balls into the goal.

        O.B.B. took Team 334 all the way to nationals in Saint Louis. Team 334 also made an appearance on Good Day New York, a large local New York City news channel, to show off the team and the 2014 robot.
