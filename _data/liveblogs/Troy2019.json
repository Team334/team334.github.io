I'm Joe and I'm proud to be the captain of the TechKnights this year. This weekend we're attending the first competition of our 20th anniversary season at the New York Tech Valley regional event. I am confident in the craftsmanship of the robot this year and immensely proud of what we've accomplished. Along with Sam, the head of our Public Relations division, I'll be bringing you updates of team life and our results. I can't wait to see what lies in store.\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    ",

            "Post": "                            After our elimination in the quarterfinals today I'm still incredibly proud of what we've accomplished for our first regional. I wanted to give you guys a little insight into the workings of 334 and share a post I sent on the team messenger this morning. It's below <p><i><b>Joseph Babbitt at 3:16AM</b> - Good Morning guys!<br> Just before I went to bed I wanted to highlight our performance today as a team. We went into this competition prepared but not confident, and I think we’ve performed amicably. Rank 16 is not a bad place to be about 2/3 through qualifications and our matches have just been getting better. I especially want to highlight the performance of our drive team.  Ahmad has been absolutely killer as drive coach given this is his first time running the show and we can all pretty much confidently say that when Ahmad takes the field, any team on our alliance listens. The strat has been absolutely killer bro. Niko and Sean, y’all got this down pat. You started off a little shaky but I saw as  the day went on you two found your flow again. I can tell that especially with a functioning robot y’all can pull off some great matches. Mike has been solid human player and has contributed more than just game pieces by also giving feedback to hatch loading which is crucial. Backing up that drive team is our ever persistent pit squad. In particular Senthia, Marie, and Halil have been killing it with the pit support. When a match ends and drive team comes in with complaints y’all handle it like pros and get to work turning our robot around in no time. Of course my man Patrick and Sam as well have been knocking out that code and keeping it solid. We’ve hit some roadblocks with our PIDS but I know y’all have been working diligently to iron those out for tomorrow so we’re gucci for elims. Matches are good but our Scouting team is what powers that amazing strat I keep loving Ahmad for. Brian, whose been heading up the operation in addition to Nimra, Ivy, Jed, Saik and Adam have been working way harder than any of us in the pit. I admire the work ethic and seriously thank y’all bc I know that you’ve had no breaks. The data is super useful and may be that secret weapon that gets us the W.  Today has definitely been a positive day, with that being said, I’m always going to push you guys to the limits. Although such a positive post may seem out of character based on my behavior during comp this is truly how I feel when we succeed. We did good today. Even so, my job is to make sure we’re not doing good, but doing the best. Until we get there I will keep pushing for more so I apologize in advance. The levels of dedication and focus were great today and I look forward to an even better performance tomorrow. We have a few more matches to play in qualifications and have to gear up for alliance selection so I have no doubt tomorrow will be a hectic day. I got faith and y’all and honestly have realized while talking to the judges just how well you all work together and in general to get this event done. Props to all of y’all both here at Troy and watching from home bc all of you built this robot together, and it’s been performing 👌<br> Let’s get this bread today.</i></p> <br> This weekend has been a totally new experience for our team in myriad ways and I already know that you should expect big things from us in 4 weeks at our next regional.\n                        ",
