title: Kickoff 2016!
author: Mymuna Begum

text: The Tech Knights attended the 2016 Kickoff at LIU Brooklyn today and are excited about this years game! Stronghold proves to be a challenge, as the team brainstorms the perfect robot. With over 10,000 different field combinations, the robot must be prepared for anything. It must also be able to scale a tower, overcome various obstacles and shoot "boulders" into opponents towers. Will the Tech Knights design an awesome knight in shining armor? You bet!
