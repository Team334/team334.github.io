text: "With only three days remaining in the build season, we are finalizing the remaining components of the robot. Though the team may be behind compared to other teams, we believe our robot clearly shows how much effort we've put in this season. The quality of this years robot will definitely show at competition. However, at the moment there is much to be done."
