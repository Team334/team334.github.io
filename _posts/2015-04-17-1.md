text: After a long, but rewarding build season, the TechKnights competed in both the New York City Regional at Javits Center, and the Long Island Regional at Hofstra University. We were semifinalists at the New York City Regional, after working hard to overcome some unexpected technical challenges at competition.We met amazing students from other teams, and have made friendships that are sure to last a lifetime. We're proud of our hard work, and are ready to take on next year's challenge!
