title: Week 1 - Building and Brainstorming 
author: Mymuna Begum 
text: The team members begin to build a practice robot to get back in the groove of build season, while designing an efficient and robust bot to represent the tech knights at Javitz. The practice bot is a great way to help teach the newest members of the team the different skills needed to build strong robots. After finishing the practice bot, they will be able to understand how to use the machines in the shop and play an active role building our robot competing in this years competition.
