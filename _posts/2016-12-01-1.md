text: On November 30th, the Tech Knights attended the Titans of Tech event, where tech alumni were honored and had the chance to share their stories of success. We are so grateful to have met so many influential and inspiring alumni at this event. The honorary ceremony allowed us to talk to some of the graduates of Tech, who’ve greatly contributed to both their field and to the tech community. We hope that through our hard work and resilience, we can follow in their foot steps. It was our pleasure to showcase the robot we passionately worked on last season and we can’t wait to build again this upcoming season. The audience was captivated by our creative design, and we hope that our technological achievement will inspire future generations of Tech, just as the alumni have inspired us.
