text: "After an abundance of angle grinding, filing and arguments over who had to use the hand-crank drill, the chassis was finally completed. The team is now manufacturing the finalized version of the gear intake system, while the indexer continues to be prototyped on the side. Unlike last year, the team has not yet faced any major mechanical issues in the start of our fourth week of build season. Hopefully, our progress isn't halted by any problems in the weeks to come."
