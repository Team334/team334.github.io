text: The team had the robot bagged and tagged right on time, after six weeks of hard work, dedication, and team work. During those weeks, we have grown as a team, and have become stronger and more efficient than we were before. In two weeks, we'll be on our way to compete at the NYC regional, with high hopes and determination.
