text: "We have been hard at work, with a very productive build season so far. We have completed the climbing mechanism and developed a working chassis. Now all that is left is the intake mechanism, gear placement, and shooting mechanism to complete the robot. We plan on meeting our goal of finishing a week in advance. The completion of our robot is just over the horizon, and the FIRST competition not very far behind."
