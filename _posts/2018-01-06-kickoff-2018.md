author: Brian Ly

text: "It's that time of year again and all FRC teams are breaking in the new year with FIRST Power Up. This year we're going retro with an old school arcade themed game. All members, new and old, of Team 334 Techknights rush to the game manual to determine the most dominant designs and strategies to later evaluate the feasibility of said designs. After a long day of excitement and months of anticipation, day two can't come soon enough."
