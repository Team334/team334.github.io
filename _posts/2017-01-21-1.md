text: "Itâ€™s officially the third week of build season and the team is scrambling to complete the CAD of the robot. Though the prototyping of the rope climbing mechanism and indexer is still underway, the team is now manufacturing this year's official chassis. With all the hectic building occurring in the lab, the programmers took to the halls with a practice robot to test their autonomous code which worked as intended. All in all, it was a day well spent for all of us!"
