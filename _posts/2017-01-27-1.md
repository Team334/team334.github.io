title: Multi-tasking and Machining
author: Mymuna Begum
division: Media

text: "Since Tuesday, the team has transformed themselves into masters of multi-tasking. With both midterm exams and the end of build season looming in the near future, we've all been extremely stressed out. The programmers have improved their autonomous code and the mechanical division has almost completed the chassis. The mentors have also started teaching new members how to use the machines in our shop."
