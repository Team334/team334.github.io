title: Deep Space, High Hopes
author: Solenne Wolfe

text: "With the season kicking off on Saturday, the 2019 build season has officially begun. This year&rsquo;s challenge Destination&#58; Deep Space involves simulated sandstorms, rocket ships, and space cargo. Luckily, this difficult game is bringing out the best of our team&rsquo;s ideas. This week, we brainstormed, created designs, and turned these into prototypes. With the prototype phase complete, the team is ahead of schedule and geared up for the season ahead."
